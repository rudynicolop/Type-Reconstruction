# Unification

Here is a specification and algorithm for constraint generation.
The algorithm is a symmetric version of that in
[Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/).

## Proven Results

- Termitation of the unification algorithm (`Unify.v`).
- The result of the algorithm unifies the constraint equations (`Properties.v`).

## In Progress

- The result of the algorithm is the principal unifier.
