# Verified Type-Reconstruction/Inference

This directory is intended as a formal-basis for the implementations in the rest of the repository.
While it is unlikely I will feel compelled to extract the computable functions to **`OCaml`** or **`Haskell`**,
the implementations here will at least provide some (informal) assurances of the correctness of
my other implementations, which will be (mostly) identical to the code found here.
